                <li>This Sector includes activities in which goods are produced by exploiting natural resources.</li>
                <li>It is also known as agricultural related sector.</li>
                <li>E.g. Dairy, Agriculture, Fishing, Horticulture, Forestry, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Secondary Sector</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This sector includes activities in which natural products are converted into useful products and
                    other forms through manufacturing. </li>
                <li>These activities takes place in a factory.</li>
                <li>It is also known as industrial sector.</li>
                <li>E.g. Manufacturing of Paper, making of bricks, manufacturing biscuits, converting cotton into a
                    clot, etc. </li>

            <li><strong>Tertiary Sector</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This sector generate services.</li>
                <li>This sector helps in the development of primary and secondary sectors.</li>
                <li>They do not produce goods but the services support the production process</li>
                <li>It is also known as service sector.</li>
                <li>E.g. Communication, transport, insurance, customer care, doctors, lawyers, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Comparing the Three Sectors</h2>
        <p>These three sectors are compared on the basis of people working in them and amount of goods and services
            produced.</p>
        <p>There are two types of goods and services:</p>
        <p><strong>Final Goods and services:</strong> These goods and services are consumed by the consumers and don't
            need any further production and processing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>These goods are included while calculating total production.</li>
            <li>E.g. Pencil, Pen, Notebooks, Biscuits</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Intermediate Goods and Services:</strong> These goods and services are used further in the production
            of goods and services.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Their value is already included in the value of final goods.</li>
            <li>That's why this is no included in the calculation of total production.</li>
            <li>E.g. Flour, Sugar, milk are used in the production of biscuits</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="key-points">
            <p><strong>The following example is given in your textbook to understand it in a more better way:-</strong>
            </p>
            <p>A farmer who sells wheat to a flour mill for Rs 20 per kg. The mill grinds the wheat and sells the flour
                to a biscuit company for Rs 25 per kg. The biscuit company uses the flour and things such as sugar and
                oil to make four packets of biscuits. It sells biscuits in the market to the consumers for Rs 80 (Rs 20
                per packet). Biscuits are the final goods, i.e., goods that reach the consumers.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="note"><strong>Gross Domestic Product:</strong> It is the sum value of all final goods and services
            produced in all the three sectors in a particular year.</p>
        <p><strong>Historical change in Sectors</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Earlier people depended on agriculture for their livelihood.</li>
            <li>Primary sector was most important sector in initial stages of development.</li>
            <li>As factories expanded, people started working in these factories in the hope of getting a better
                livelihood.</li>
            <li>With the development of technology, a shift occurred from secondary to tertiary sector in developed
                countries.</li>
            <li>Today, tertiary sector remains the most important in terms of production and employment.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why the importance of tertiary sector is rising in the production?</h2>
        <p>There are four major reasons to support this answer:- </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In a country government has the responsibility to fulfill the basic need of its population. In order to
                do
                that it opens schools, hospitals, banks colleges, courts, police stations, etc. </li>
            <li>The rapid development in the industrial sector and agriculture sector, other tertiary services like
                transportation, communication, trade, storage, etc. services are also required.</li>
            <li>Increase in the income levels of people has led people demanding several other services like tourism,
                private schools and hospitals, shopping and other leisure services.</li>
            <li>Rapid development in the information and technology and its increased consumption and rising demands.
            </li>
            <li>To provide all these services government and other institutions recruit teachers, doctors, software
                engineers, drivers, soldiers, civil servants, policemen, etc. </li>
        </ul>

            <li>This scheme guarantee 100 days of wage employment in a year for those who are in search of work in rural
                areas.</li>
            <li>If Government failed to do so then it will pay unemployment allowances to the people.</li>
            <li>The Central Government in India made this law to implement the Right to Work in 625 districts.</li>
            <li>The Act encourages women’s participation, and at least one-third (33%) of the jobs are reserved for

        <p><strong>How can we protect the workers in the unorganised sector?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strengthening the laws to protect the workers in the unorganised sectors.</li>
            <li>Helping small scale industries to grow in the rural and urban areas so that they don't need to work in
                unorganised sectors.</li>
            <li>Supporting the farmers in the rural areas through adequate irrigation facilities, timely delivery of
                seeds, increasing MSP on produce, etc.</li>

        <h2>Role of Public Sector</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Government provides facilities which the private sector will not provide at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>The government has to support the private sector so that they can continue their production or business.
            </li>
            <li>The GOI buys wheat and rice from farmers at a fair price. It stores this in its godowns and sells at a
                lower price to consumers through ration. This way Gov. supports both farmers and consumers.</li>
            <li>Government needs to pay attention to aspects of human development such as availability of drinking
                water, housing facilities, food and nutrition, etc.</li>
            <li>It is the duty of the government to take care of the poorest and ignored regions of the country through
                increased spending in such areas.</li>
