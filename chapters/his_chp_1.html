            </li>

        <p><strong> Frankfurt Parliament was the first freely elected all-German national assembly, formed in May 1848
                during the liberal revolutions across Europe.</strong></p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <li><strong>Where:</strong> Convened in the Church of St. Paul, Frankfurt.</li>
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> Composed of 831 elected representatives, mainly from the middle class – professionals,
            businessmen, and artisans.</li>
        <li><strong>Aim:</strong> To draft a constitution for a unified German nation based on liberal and
            constitutional principles.</li>
        <p><strong>Key Proposals:</strong></p>

            <li>A parliamentary system</li>

        <p><strong>However:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The crown was offered to King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, who rejected it, unwilling to accept a
                crown from the people.</li>
            <li>The parliament lacked support from workers and faced opposition from monarchy and military.</li>
            <li>It eventually failed and was disbanded by force.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Revolutions of 1848[Events in France]</h2>

            <li>Despite their involvement, they were denied voting rights and excluded from formal political processes.
            </li>
            <li>In the Frankfurt Parliament, women were only allowed as observers in the visitors' gallery.</li>
            <li>The demand for women’s political rights remained unfulfilled.</li>

        <h2>Aftermath of 1848 Revolutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Though liberal revolutions were suppressed, monarchs couldn’t fully restore the old order.</li>

        <h2>Unification of Germany[Important]</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Germany was divided into 39 confederations by Napoleon Bonaparte.
            <li>In 1834, a Customs Union or Zollverein was formed which abolished tariff barriers and reduced the
                numbers of currencies from over thirty to two. This unified the German estates Economically.
            <li>Later, in 1848, the middle class tried to unite the different regions in the German confederation into a
                nation state governed by an elected parliament headed by the king.
            <li>These efforts faced strong opposition from the monarchy, military and landowners(Junkers) in Prussia.
            <li>Friderich Wilhelm IV of Prussia used the military and forcefully disbanded the assembly.
            <li>After this failed attempt Otto Von Bismarck the chief minister of Prussia used the military and
                bureaucracy with an aim to achieve German Unification.
            <li>Three battles were fought over seven years with Austria, France and Denmark where Prussia emerged
                victorious.
            <li>In January 1871, Kaiser William I, the King of Prussia, was declared the Emperor of Unified Germany in a
                ceremony held at the Palace of Versailles.

        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Role of Cavour</strong></p>
        <ul>

        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-18th century:</strong> No unified British nation. People identified as English, Welsh,
                Scots, or Irish, with separate cultural and political traditions.</li>
            <li>The idea of a British nation-state developed gradually over time, not through a single revolution or
                upheaval.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Role of England</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>As England grew in wealth and power, it extended influence over the other nations of the British Isles.
            </li>
            <li>English Parliament played a crucial role after 1688, when it seized power from the monarchy and began
                forming the British nation-state with England at the center.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Acts and Events</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1707: Act of Union created the United Kingdom of Great Britain, uniting England and Scotland.</li>
            <li>England dominated the British Parliament, and Scottish culture and political institutions were
                suppressed.</li>
            <li>Scottish Gaelic language and traditional dress were banned, and Highland clans faced repression.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Capturing Ireland</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ireland was divided between Catholics and Protestants, with Protestants supported by England.</li>
            <li>After the 1798 revolt led by Wolfe Tone's United Irishmen, Ireland was forcibly incorporated into the
                United Kingdom in 1801.</li>
            <li>A British identity was propagated through English culture, including the Union Jack, God Save the King,
                and the English language.</li>
            <li>Scotland and Ireland became subordinate partners within the British Union, with their cultures
                marginalized.</li>

        <h2>Visualising the Nation</h2>
        <p><strong>Personification of Nations in Art</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the 18th and 19th centuries, artists personified nations by representing them as female figures to
                give an abstract concept a concrete form.</li>
            <li>Female allegories were used to represent the nation rather than a specific woman, becoming symbolic
                representations of the country.</li>
            <li>During the French Revolution, female allegories like Liberty, Justice, and the Republic were depicted
                using specific symbols:</li>
            <li>Liberty: Red cap, broken chains</li>
            <li>Justice: Blindfolded woman with weighing scales</li>
            <li>Marianne personified France.</li>
            <li>She symbolized a people's nation with characteristics like the red cap, tricolour, and cockade.</li>
            <li>Statues of Marianne were placed in public squares, and her image appeared on coins and stamps.</li>
            <li>Germania became the allegory of the German nation, often depicted wearing a crown of oak leaves,
                symbolizing heroism.</li>

        <h2>Nationalism and Imperialism</h2>
        <p><strong>I. Nationalism in the Late 19th Century and the Balkans</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nationalism turned from liberal-democratic ideals to narrow, aggressive ambitions.</li>
            <li>Nationalist groups became intolerant, often leading to conflict and war.</li>
            <li>Major powers exploited nationalism for imperialist goals.</li>
            <li>The Balkans became the most serious source of nationalist tension in Europe after 1871.</li>
            <li>Region comprised modern-day Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
                Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro.</li>
            <li>Inhabitants broadly known as Slavs, most of the region was under the Ottoman Empire.</li>
            <li>Romantic nationalism and the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire made the Balkans very explosive.</li>
            <li>Balkan nationalities used history to prove their past independence and viewed struggles as efforts to
                win back long-lost independence.</li>
            <li>Balkan states were fiercely jealous of each other, hoping to gain more territory.</li>
            <li>Rivalries among Balkan states and interference from European powers (Russia, Germany, England,
                Austro-Hungary) escalated tensions.</li>
            <li>This rivalry and territorial ambitions led to frequent wars and ultimately led to World War I.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>II. Nationalism and Anti-Imperial Movements Worldwide</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nationalism, aligned with imperialism, led Europe to disaster in 1914.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, many countries colonised by European powers in the 19th century began to oppose
                imperial domination.</li>
            <li>These anti-imperial movements were nationalist, aiming to form independent nation-states.</li>
            <li>They were driven by a sense of collective national unity, forged in confrontation with imperialism.</li>
            <li>Though inspired by Europe, European ideas of nationalism were nowhere replicated.</li>
            <li>Societies developed their own specific variety of nationalism.</li>
            <li>The concept that societies should be organised into ‘nation-states’ became seen as natural and
                universal.</li>
